## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process: t1
 - Time to compute row counts: t2
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts: t3
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic: t4
 


Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?
A:  Assuming n in the number of rows, t1 and t3 will strongly depend on n. The total time is: T = t1 + t2 + t3 + t4

2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?
A: If t2 is the average time to count 1 row, T = n*t2

3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?
A: The parallel method will take less time when t1+t2+t3 is less than (n-1)*t2
